# Human Constraint Intelligence Layer

Early prototype rule-based system that flags early signs of operational fragility, fatigue, overload, and task duration drift before they become mission failures.

## What It Does

- Detects deviation from plan duration
- Accounts for poor sleep and task exposure
- Suggests adaptation options

## Why It Exists

I built this to explore how human constraint and real-world complexity can be reasoned about, even without machine learning. This is early logic meant to run where assumptions quietly fail and humans get overloaded.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
